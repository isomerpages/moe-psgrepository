<h3><strong>Maintaining Ties with School</strong></h3>
<p>PSGs are the bridge between the parent community and the school. Regular
communication with the school enables strong school-home partnership, by
strengthening the PSGâ€™s ability to contribute meaningfully and maximising
PSG's impact on parents and children.</p>

<h3><strong>Cultivating Relationships within PSG</strong></h3>
<p>The PSG, like any volunteer group, is built on relationships. Parents
are likely to stay engaged when they feel valued and connected within the
community. To build a strong PSG community, we need to foster and sustain
the relationships through bonding activities and open communication within
the PSG.</p>

<h3><strong>Managing Differences</strong></h3>
<p>PSGs have to work closely with the school and other parents. At times,
PSGs may have to manage difficult situations. Below are some examples PSGs
may face, and ways to understand and manage the situations better. Ultimately,
it is important to bear in mind and remind each other that regardless of
our differences, we all need to work in the best interests of children
in the school and role model what we wish to see in our parent community
and children.</p>
