<h3><strong>Maintaining Ties with School</strong></h3>
<p>PSGs are the bridge between the parent community and the school. Regular
communication with the school enables strong school-home partnership, by
strengthening the PSGâ€™s ability to contribute meaningfully and maximising
PSG's impact on parents and children.</p>

<h3><strong>Cultivating Relationships within PSG</strong></h3>
<p>The PSG, like any volunteer group, is built on relationships. Parents
are likely to stay engaged when they feel valued and connected within the
community.</p>

<h3><strong>Managing Differences</strong></h3>
<p>PSGs have to work closely with the school and other parents. At times,
PSGs may have to manage difficult situations. It is important to bear in
mind and remind each other that regardless of our differences, we all need
to work in the best interests of children in the school and role model
what we wish to see in our parent community and children.</p>
