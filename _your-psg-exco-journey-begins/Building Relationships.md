<h3><strong>Maintaining Ties with School</strong></h3>
<p>PSGs are the bridge between the parent community and the school. Regular
communication with the school enables strong school-home partnership, by
strengthening the PSGâ€™s ability to contribute meaningfully and maximising
PSG's impact on parents and children.</p>

<h3><strong>Cultivating Relationships within PSG</strong></h3>
<p>The PSG, like any volunteer group, is built on relationships. Parents
are likely to stay engaged when they feel valued and connected within the
community.</p>

<h3><strong>Managing Differences</strong></h3>
<p>PSGs have to work closely with the school and other parents. At times,
PSGs may have to manage difficult situations.</p>
<p>It is important to remember - and to remind one another - that despite
our differences, we are united in working for the best interests of the
children. By modelling the values and behaviours we hope to see in our
parent community and children, we create a stronger, more supportive school
environment.</p>
