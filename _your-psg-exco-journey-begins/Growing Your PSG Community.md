<li>
<p>Develop more positive attitudes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have better school attendance and complete homework more consistently;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be better at bridging the cultural gap between school and home; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be less anti-social and less prone to behavioural issues.</p>
</li>
</ul>
