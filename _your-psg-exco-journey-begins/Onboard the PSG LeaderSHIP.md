<p>Congratulations on your new/ continued appointment as a PSG Leader. As
an Executive Committee (EXCO) member, you are in a unique position to steer
and contribute to your <a href="/your-support-circle/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Support Circle</a>,
PSG team and the parent community.</p>
<p>It is useful to review:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>your <strong>PSG structure</strong>, regardless of how big or small, young
or mature your PSG is. This includes updating the PSG EXCO roles based
on the latest needs of the PSG or school; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your PSG's <strong><u>Terms of Reference (template #x)</u></strong>, which
are useful in defining how the PSG works and its purpose.</p>
</li>
</ul>
