<p>PSGs have a big part to play in enriching our childrenâ€™s school life.
The activities and programmes should aim to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>support the<strong> child</strong> to enrich his/her learning in school;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support the <strong>school</strong> to strengthen school-based activities
and initiatives;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support the <strong>teachers </strong>to bring out the best in our children;
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support other <strong>parents </strong>in their parenting journey.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Things to Note Before the Activity</strong></h3>
<p>Develop an <a href="https://gccprod.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/MOE-PSG-MST/Shared%20Documents/PSG%20site/Templates%20and%20Checklists/To%20upload/Template%20x-%20Action%20Plan.docx?d=wd86de077e81d4cc69cf630e6ac65a82f&amp;csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=zmGKte" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">action plan</a> for
your activity. Remember to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>consult your school partnership staff and school leaders to ensure alignment
and maximise the impact of your efforts; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consider the modality of the event (physical, virtual, or hybrid) to best
suit the needs of the activity and the participants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consider assigning at least 2 volunteers to organise each activity to
share the workload; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring there is a teacher-in-charge and a key parent coordinator for
smooth communication between the school and the PSG.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Physical Activities</strong></h3>
<p>Here are some examples of physical events and/or activities which PSGs
have conducted:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><u>Major School Events</u> (e.g. festival celebrations, career talks, sports
day)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Parent-Child Bonding</u> (e.g. community outreach activities, Dads for
Life Camps, cook-outs)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>PSG Bonding Activities</u> (e.g. parenting talks, inter-school PSG networking
session, learning journeys for parents)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Virtual Activities</strong></h3>
<p>Here are some considerations for organising virtual events:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Choose the right platform: Ensure it is user-friendly and suits your event's
needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test your tech: Run a rehearsal to iron out potential glitches</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engage your audience: Incorporate interactive elements to maintain interest,
such as asking parents to participate by asking/replying to questions or
polls in the chat feature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plan for accessibility: Consider participants with different tech skills
or needs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Post-Activities Review</strong></h3>
<p>After each event, it is important to hold a review with all stakeholders
involved. The feedback we gather from such reviews will be very helpful
for the PSG and the school when we plan our next activity.</p>
