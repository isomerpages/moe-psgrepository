<p>PSGs have a big part to play in enriching our childrenâ€™s school life.
The activities and programmes should aim to support:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The<strong> children</strong> to enrich their learning in school;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>school</strong> to strengthen school-based activities and initiatives;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>teachers </strong>to bring out the best in the children; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other <strong>parents </strong>on their parenting journey.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Things to Note Before the Activity</strong></h3>
<p>Develop an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cSjt7s17wOCoiqjzfhI_826t-WrKs1k7/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=106023042640212375039&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Action Plan (Template #4)</a> for
your activity. Remember to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Consult your school leaders and partnership teacher-in-charge to ensure
alignment and maximise the impact of your efforts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider the modality of the event (physical, virtual, or hybrid) to best
suit the needs of the activity and the participants;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider assigning at least 2 volunteers to organise each activity to
share the workload; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure there is a teacher in-charge and a key parent coordinator for smooth
communication between the school and the PSG.</p>

<h4><strong>Physical Activities</strong></h4>
<p>Here are some examples of physical events and/or activities which PSGs
have conducted:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><u>Major School Events</u> (e.g. festival celebrations, career talks, sports
day);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Parent-Child Bonding</u> (e.g. community outreach activities, Dads for
Life Camps, cook-outs); and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>PSG Bonding Activities</u> (e.g. parenting talks, inter-school PSG networking
sessions, learning journeys for parents).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Virtual Activities</strong></h4>
<p>Here are some considerations for organising virtual events:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><u>Choose the right platform:</u> Ensure it is user-friendly and suits
your event's needs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Test your tech:</u> Run a rehearsal to iron out potential glitches;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Engage your audience:</u> Incorporate interactive elements to maintain
interest, such as inviting parents to participate by asking/replying to
questions or polls in the chat feature; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Plan for accessibility:</u> Consider participants with different tech
skills or needs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Post-Activities Review</strong></h3>
<p>After each event, it is important to hold a review with all stakeholders
involved. The feedback gathered from such reviews will be very helpful
for the PSG and the school when you plan your next activity.</p>
