<p>The PSG EXCO should discuss the work plan with the PSG Partnership teacher
in-charge and school leaders. An effective PSG work plan should be aligned
with the:</p>

<li>
<p>School’s strategic thrusts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>School's calendar of events;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interests and concerns of parents throughout the year;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resource considerations (e.g. parent volunteers required to help out);</p>

<h3><strong>Managing PSG Finances</strong></h3>
<p>As partners, PSGs will need to align their plans, budget and processes
with the school. Beyond understanding the school’s priorities for the year
to develop the PSG work plan, do check with the school on the financial
processes as <strong>all PSG expenditure should come from the school’s PSG Fund.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
