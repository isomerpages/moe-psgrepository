<h3><strong>Developing Annual Work Plan</strong></h3>
<p>It is good to draw up an annual work pla<u>n ***</u><strong><u>(template #x- </u></strong>

activities throughout the year.</p>
<p>The PSG EXCO should discuss the work plan with the PSG Partnership teacher
in-charge and school leaders. An effective PSG work plan is aligned with:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>the schoolâ€™s strategic thrusts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>school's calendar of events</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what parents will be paying attention to at a specific time, such as those
reflected in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ymzhV-EsnxCTcWyUUFtowBhWR7h9AWfd/view" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">PSG planning calendar</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>resource considerations (e.g. parent volunteers required to help out)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>time required for preparation, including recruiting and briefing the parent
volunteers.</p>

</ul>
<h3><strong>Managing Communications Channel within PSG</strong></h3>
<p>As an EXCO member, you will need to coordinate communication and resources
within the PSG. Here are some reminders on managing team chats.</p>

<h3><strong>Managing PSG Finances</strong></h3>
<p>Recognising that PSGs are supporting schools in their efforts, every school
has set aside funds for their PSGs, called the PSG Fund, based on projected
needs and priorities for the year. As such, <strong>all PSG expenditure should come from the PSG Fund</strong>
</p>
<p>PSGs may wish to refer to the managing finances checklist <strong><u>(template # </u></strong>
<a href="/files/Managing_PSG_Finances_Checklist.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">file</a><strong><u>)</u> </strong>which outlines key steps when tapping
on PSG Funds.</p>
