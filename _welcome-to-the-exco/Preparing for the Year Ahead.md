<h3><strong>Managing PSG Finances</strong></h3>
<p>Recognising that PSGs are supporting schools in their efforts, every school
has set aside funds for their PSGs, called the PSG Fund, based on projected
needs and priorities for the year. As such, <strong>all PSG expenditure should come from the PSG Fund.</strong>
</p>
<p><u>&lt;&lt;meme&gt;&gt;</u>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>PSG Fund Facts:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Since 2017, the PSG Fund has been provided for under the School Operating
Fund (SOF) Block Grant to provide schools with greater flexibility in planning
parent engagement activities/programmes with their PSGs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The allocation and use of PSG Funds are guided by the School Financial
Instruction Manual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As PSGs’ operations and events are in support of and on behalf of schools,
if PSGs wish to fundraise, the school needs to seek MOE’s approval.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To unlock the PSG Funds, PSGs should:</p>
<p>a) At the start of the year</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Draw up workplan with estimated budget/ resources required
for each programme.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Discuss with schools on plans and budget/ resources required
so that it can be factored in the upcoming year’s budget</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>Ask if the school could provide PSG with updates
on financial guidelines at a frequency both the school and PSG are comfortable
with, ensuring transparency and that everyone is kept up to date with developments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Seek school’s approval of overall budget</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip: Understand your school’s key considerations when approving PSG’s
workplans or activity budget.</p>

<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Designate a PSG member to track budget and expenditure for
the year, and decide on the frequency of budget updates within PSG.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip: Alfred Tay, Chairperson (2024) from Kong Hwa School shares that their
finance management is governed by the PSG’s Constitution. Generally, event
budgets must be approved by the executive committee (subject to monthly
limits), and payment or claim certifications must be verified by the chairman
and treasurer. For substantial budgets, they require approval from the
annual general meeting (AGM) or extraordinary general meeting (EGM).</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When preparing
for an upcoming parent engagement activity, PSGs should work within the
allocated budget to plan the event:</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Meet the Partnership teacher in-charge of the event and
come to a common consensus on the objective, theme and the overall budget.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Discuss with the school the financial processes and requirements
such as which party is handling the procurement procedures, who is keeping
tabs on the expenditure and receipts for the activity.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide the school with a detailed breakdown of estimated
expenditure and necessary documentations, ensuring that projected and actual
expenditure stays within the allocated budget. An example of breakdown
is below (exact details dependent on school):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tip: PSG member from Sembawang Primary School Siti Dhamirah suggests recycling
items from previous events, or even DIY some items together. We think a
DIY session could make for a great PSG bonding activity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>When buying items or collecting fees it is important to ensure proper
accountability and guard against disputes or fraud:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All PSG expenses
should be billed to the school and paid directly by the school to the vendors.
If it is necessary for PSGs to pay for the expense first, check with the
Partnership teacher in-charge before payment to ensure that reimbursement
is permitted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip: Check if your school has a school corporate card for PSG expenses
to be charged to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask for and retain
receipts. It is a good practice to scan or photocopy receipts as the ink
on receipts may fade.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of public
fund accountability, parents should not transfer money relating to PSG
operations and events to any personal accounts.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When collecting
fees for programmes (e.g. workshops/classes), the money must immediately
be handed to the school personnel to ensure that there is clear accountability.</p>
