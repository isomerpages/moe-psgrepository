<h3><strong>Developing Annual Work Plan</strong></h3>
<p>It is good to draw up an annual work pla<u>n ***</u><strong><u>(template #x)***</u></strong> to
ensure a good spread of activities throughout the year.</p>
<p>The PSG EXCO should discuss the work plan with the PSG Partnership teacher
in-charge and school leaders. An effective PSG work plan is aligned with:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>the school’s strategic thrusts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>school's calendar of events</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what parents will be paying attention to at a specific time, such as those
reflected in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ymzhV-EsnxCTcWyUUFtowBhWR7h9AWfd/view" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">PSG planning calendar</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>resource considerations (e.g. parent volunteers required to help out)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>time required for preparation, including recruiting and briefing the parent
volunteers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Managing PSG Finances</strong></h3>
<p>Recognising that PSGs are supporting schools in their efforts, every school
has set aside funds for their PSGs, called the PSG Fund, based on projected
needs and priorities for the year. As such, <strong>all PSG expenditure should come from the PSG Fund.</strong>

<p>PSG Fund Facts:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Since 2017, the PSG Fund has been provided for under the School Operating
Fund (SOF) Block Grant to provide schools with greater flexibility in planning
parent engagement activities/programmes with their PSGs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The allocation and use of PSG Funds are guided by the School Financial
Instruction Manual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As PSGs’ operations and events are in support of and on behalf of schools,
if PSGs wish to fundraise, the school needs to seek MOE’s approval.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>PSGs may wish to refer to the managing finances checklist <strong><u>(template #x)</u> </strong>which
outlines key steps when tapping on PSG Funds.</p>

<p>Tips:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Ask if the school could provide PSG with updates on financial guidelines
at a frequency both the school and PSG are comfortable with, ensuring transparency
and that everyone is kept up to date with developments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Event budgets must be approved by the executive committee (subject to
monthly limits), and payment or claim certifications must be verified by
the chairman and treasurer. <em>- Alfred Tay, Chairperson (2024) from Kong Hwa School)</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recycle items from previous events, or even DIY some items together. <em>- Siti Dhamirah, PSG member from Sembawang Primary School</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check if your school has a school corporate card for PSG expenses to be
charged to which could simplify some processes.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><u>**&lt;change to checklist&gt;**</u></strong>
</p>
<p>To use the PSG Funds, PSGs should:</p>
<p>a) At the start of the year</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Draw up workplan with estimated budget/ resources required for each programme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discuss with schools on plans and budget/ resources required so that it
can be factored in the upcoming year’s budget</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seek school’s approval of overall budget</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip: Understand your school’s key considerations when approving PSG’s
workplans or activity budget.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Designate a PSG member to track budget and expenditure for the year, and
decide on the frequency of budget updates within PSG.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When preparing
for an upcoming parent engagement activity, PSGs should work within the
allocated budget to plan the event:</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Meet the Partnership teacher in-charge of the event and
come to a common consensus on the objective, theme and the overall budget.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Discuss with the school the financial processes and requirements
such as which party is handling the procurement procedures, who is keeping
tabs on the expenditure and receipts for the activity.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide the school with a detailed breakdown of estimated
expenditure and necessary documentations, ensuring that projected and actual
expenditure stays within the allocated budget. An example of breakdown
is below (exact details dependent on school):</p>
<table style="minWidth: 75px">
<colgroup>
<col>
<col>
<col>
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p><strong>Item/ Services</strong>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p><strong>Estimated Value</strong>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p><strong>How to procure this?</strong>
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>e.g. Printing posters in colour</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>$50</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Buy from XX company. See quotation in attachment.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p></p>
<p>When buying items or collecting fees it is important to ensure proper
accountability and guard against disputes or fraud:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All PSG expenses
should be billed to the school and paid directly by the school to the vendors.
If it is necessary for PSGs to pay for the expense first, check with the
Partnership teacher in-charge before payment to ensure that reimbursement
is permitted.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask for and retain
receipts. It is a good practice to scan or photocopy receipts as the ink
on receipts may fade.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of public
fund accountability, parents should not transfer money relating to PSG
operations and events to any personal accounts.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When collecting
fees for programmes (e.g. workshops/classes), the money must immediately
be handed to the school personnel to ensure that there is clear accountability.</p>
