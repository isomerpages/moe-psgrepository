<p>Once the PSG is formed, we can focus on sustaining it by increasing membership
and building relationships within the PSG.</p>
<p><u>&lt;&lt;consider card of "Building Rapport with Stakeholders" and "Planning for Events"?&gt;&gt;</u>
</p>
<h3><strong>Recruitment and Outreach</strong></h3>
<p>Growing your PSG is important for long-term success and impact. New parents
who join the school each year can be part of the PSG community and offer
fresh perspectives to enrich the PSG. Consider these ‘RITE’ steps when
reaching out and recruiting new members:</p>
<p><u>&lt;&lt;image of RITE&gt;&gt;</u>
</p>
<h3><strong>Cultivate Relationships among Parents</strong></h3>
<p>The PSG, like any volunteer group, is built on relationships. Parents
are likely to stay engaged when they feel valued and connected within the
community. To build a strong PSG community, we need to foster and sustain
the relationships through bonding activities and open communication within
the PSG, and between the PSG and the school.</p>
<p><u>&lt;&lt;image of ideas&gt;&gt;</u>
</p>
<h3><strong>Maintain Communication with School</strong></h3>
<p>Regular communication with the school fosters a collaborative mindset
that the PSG is part of the school and strengthens the PSG’s ability to
contribute meaningfully and maximising their impact.</p>
<p><u>&lt;&lt;image&gt; &gt;</u>
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Managing Differences</strong></h3>
<p>In a PSG, we have to work closely with the school and other parents. At
times, we may have to manage difficult situations. Below are some examples
PSGs may face, and how we can understand and manage the situations better.
Ultimately, it is important to bear in mind and remind each other that
regardless of our differences, we all need to work in the best interests
of children in the school and role model what we wish to see in our children.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, we set aside our personal indifferences, we overcome the challenges
and run the show for the benefits of our students, teachers and parents.</p>
<p><em>- Mdm Titiek Rohani, Zonal Leader (East)</em>
</p>

<h3><strong>Event &amp; Activity Planning</strong></h3>
<p>We have a big part to play in enriching our children’s school life, whether
we collaborate with the school for key school programmes, or organise parent-centric
activities. The activities and programmes that we plan should aim to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>support the<strong> child</strong> to enrich his/her learning in school;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support the <strong>school</strong> to strengthen school-based activities
and initiatives;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support the <strong>teachers </strong>to bring out the best in our children;
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support other <strong>parents </strong>in their parenting journey.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Effective PSGs bridge the needs of the parent community with the school's
objectives. Before planning events or activities, remember to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>consult your school partnership staff and school leaders to ensure alignment
and maximise the impact of your efforts; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consider the modality of the event (physical, virtual, or hybrid) to best
suit the needs of the activity and the participants.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As we plan for the event/activity, here are some areas that we can consider:</p>
<p>&lt;checklist/ image of areas&gt;</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Physical Events and Activities</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>Here are some examples of physical events and/or activities which PSGs
have conducted. We hope you find some ideas here.</p>

<p><u>&lt;&lt;put examples as cards?&gt;&gt;</u>
</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Virtual Events and Activities</strong></h4>
<p>Since the Covid-19 pandemic, many PSGs have discovered the power of virtual
platforms to conduct events and activities, and have tapped on them to
keep communities connected, bridging distances and overcoming physical
limitations.</p>
<p>From online workshops to virtual family-bonding activities, the possibilities
are endless. However, organising a successful virtual event requires careful
planning to maximise the impact of each event. Tapping on technology may
help you reach out to more parents but you may be unable to capture their
full attention. Here are some additional considerations for organising
virtual events:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Choose the right platform: Ensure it is user-friendly and suits your event's
needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test your tech: Run a rehearsal to iron out potential glitches</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engage your audience: Incorporate interactive elements to maintain interest,
such as asking parents to participate by asking/replying to questions or
polls in the chat feature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plan for accessibility: Consider participants with different tech skills
or needs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Review Your Events and Activities</strong></h3>
<p>After each event, it is important to hold a review with all parents involved.
The feedback we gather from such reviews will be very helpful for the PSG
and the school when we plan our next event.</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who leads the review?</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typically, a review is best led by the parent(s)
who is/are in charge of the event.</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who should be involved?</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents who have helped out or
participated can give valuable feedback.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; School staff can also provide comments
from a different perspective.</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When do you do a review?</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do a quick review immediately after
the event, as the experience will be fresh in everyone’s mind.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some PSGs meet regularly (e.g.
every two months or termly) to discuss initiative and review programmes. <em>(Amizah, Admiralty Sec Sch staff &amp; Jacqueline, Riverside Pri Sch staff)</em>
</p>
<p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do you need to do a review?</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A framework to guide the review
discussion can be very helpful.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A simple framework to use is Keep,
Improve, Start, Stop (KISS), which prompts us to think about both the effective
and less effective parts of a programme.</p>
<p>Keep – Which parts are working well and should continue?</p>
<p>Improve – Which parts can be done better?</p>
<p>Start – What initiatives can we start to enhance school-home partnership?</p>
<p>Stop – Which parts are ineffective and do not benefit anyone?</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Managing PSG Finances</strong></h3>
<p>Recognising that PSGs are supporting schools in their efforts, every school
has set aside funds for their PSGs, called the PSG Fund, based on projected
needs and priorities for the year. As such, <strong>all PSG expenditure should come from the PSG Fund.</strong>
</p>
<p><u>&lt;&lt;meme&gt;&gt;</u>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>PSG Fund Facts:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Since 2017, the PSG Fund has been provided for under the School Operating
Fund (SOF) Block Grant to provide schools with greater flexibility in planning
parent engagement activities/programmes with their PSGs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The allocation and use of PSG Funds are guided by the School Financial
Instruction Manual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As PSGs’ operations and events are in support of and on behalf of schools,
if PSGs wish to fundraise, the school needs to seek MOE’s approval.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To unlock the PSG Funds, PSGs should:</p>
<p>a) At the start of the year</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Draw up workplan with estimated budget/ resources required
for each programme.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Discuss with schools on plans and budget/ resources required
so that it can be factored in the upcoming year’s budget</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>Ask if the school could provide PSG with updates
on financial guidelines at a frequency both the school and PSG are comfortable
with, ensuring transparency and that everyone is kept up to date with developments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Seek school’s approval of overall budget</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip: Understand your school’s key considerations when approving PSG’s
workplans or activity budget.</p>

<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Designate a PSG member to track budget and expenditure for
the year, and decide on the frequency of budget updates within PSG.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip: Alfred Tay, Chairperson (2024) from Kong Hwa School shares that their
finance management is governed by the PSG’s Constitution. Generally, event
budgets must be approved by the executive committee (subject to monthly
limits), and payment or claim certifications must be verified by the chairman
and treasurer. For substantial budgets, they require approval from the
annual general meeting (AGM) or extraordinary general meeting (EGM).</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When preparing
for an upcoming parent engagement activity, PSGs should work within the
allocated budget to plan the event:</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Meet the Partnership teacher in-charge of the event and
come to a common consensus on the objective, theme and the overall budget.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Discuss with the school the financial processes and requirements
such as which party is handling the procurement procedures, who is keeping
tabs on the expenditure and receipts for the activity.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide the school with a detailed breakdown of estimated
expenditure and necessary documentations, ensuring that projected and actual
expenditure stays within the allocated budget. An example of breakdown
is below (exact details dependent on school):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tip: PSG member from Sembawang Primary School Siti Dhamirah suggests recycling
items from previous events, or even DIY some items together. We think a
DIY session could make for a great PSG bonding activity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>When buying items or collecting fees it is important to ensure proper
accountability and guard against disputes or fraud:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All PSG expenses
should be billed to the school and paid directly by the school to the vendors.
If it is necessary for PSGs to pay for the expense first, check with the
Partnership teacher in-charge before payment to ensure that reimbursement
is permitted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip: Check if your school has a school corporate card for PSG expenses
to be charged to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask for and retain
receipts. It is a good practice to scan or photocopy receipts as the ink
on receipts may fade.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of public
fund accountability, parents should not transfer money relating to PSG
operations and events to any personal accounts.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When collecting
fees for programmes (e.g. workshops/classes), the money must immediately
be handed to the school personnel to ensure that there is clear accountability.</p>
