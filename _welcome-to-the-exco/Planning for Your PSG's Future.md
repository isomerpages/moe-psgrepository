<h3><strong>Preparing for Succession</strong></h3>
<p>A succession plan ensures that new leaders are ready to take over when
an experienced team graduates from the PSG.</p>
<p>Brewing a strong PSG leadership is like making the perfect cup of tea.
Just follow the <strong>SIP</strong> method: <strong>S</strong>et up sub-committees, <strong>I</strong>dentify
potential leaders, and <strong>P</strong>air them with experienced mentors.
Steep in this process, and you'll have a refreshing blend of new and seasoned
leaders ready to serve the school community.</p>

<p>Elina, Chairperson (2024) of Yu Neng Pri School shares that for her PSG,
new members will be shortlisted by Term 3. In Term 4, they will confirm
the final list of new members.</p>

<p>What are some attributes of potential leaders?</p>
<p>A PSG member who:</p>
<p>a) Has the right attitude and the right intention</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; When potential leaders want to support the school in enriching
the students’ learning environment, the PSG would be more collaborative,
and align itself more closely with school priorities and goals.</p>
<p>b) Invests his/her time, energy and effort to serve the students and school</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; When potential leaders ‘make’ time to serve, they show that
serving alongside the PSG is an important aspect in their lives.</p>
<p>c) Values mutual respect</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; This shows when potential leaders strive to understand,
acknowledge, appreciate and accept viewpoints that may be different from
their own.</p>

<h4><strong>Handover Process</strong></h4>
<p>Handover can be an opportunity for bonding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We will have a farewell BBQ party for outgoing EXCO and incoming EXCO
to meet-and-greet and handover. After all we are all volunteers and we
must enjoy what we do together so we choose to do it leisurely like a friends
gathering.</p>
<p><em>- David Ng, Chairperson (2024) of Xin Min Secondary School</em>
