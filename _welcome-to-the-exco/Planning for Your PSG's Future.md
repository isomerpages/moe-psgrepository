<h3><strong>Preparing for Succession</strong></h3>
<p>A succession plan ensures that new leaders are ready to take over when
an experienced team graduates from the PSG.</p>
<p>Brewing a strong PSG leadership is like making the perfect cup of tea.
Just follow the <strong>SIP</strong> method: <strong>S</strong>et up sub-committees, <strong>I</strong>dentify
potential leaders, and <strong>P</strong>air them with experienced mentors.
Steep in this process, and you'll have a refreshing blend of new and seasoned
leaders ready to serve the school community.</p>
