<h3><strong>Preparing for Succession</strong></h3>
<p>A succession plan ensures that new leaders are ready to take over when
an experienced team graduates from the PSG.</p>
<p>Brewing a strong PSG leadership is like making the perfect cup of tea.
Just follow the <strong>SIP</strong> method!</p>

</ul>
<h3><strong>Attributes of Potential Leaders</strong></h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Has the right attitude and the right intention </strong>-<strong> </strong>When
potential leaders want to support the school in enriching the students’
learning environment, the PSG would be more collaborative, and align itself
more closely with school priorities and goals.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Invests his/her time, energy and effort to serve the students and school</strong> -
When potential leaders ‘make’ time to serve, they show that serving alongside
the PSG is an important aspect in their lives.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Values mutual respect</strong> - This shows when potential leaders
strive to understand, acknowledge, appreciate and accept viewpoints that
may be different from their own.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Handover Process</strong></h4>
<p>Ensure that for every leadership succession, there is proper handover.
Customise this <strong><u>handover checklist (Template #)</u></strong> for
your PSG!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Did you know that handover can be an opportunity for bonding?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We will have a farewell BBQ party for outgoing EXCO and incoming EXCO
to meet-and-greet and handover. After all we are all volunteers and we
must enjoy what we do together so we choose to do it leisurely like a friends
gathering.</p>
<p><em>- David Ng, Chairperson (2024) of Xin Min Secondary School</em>
