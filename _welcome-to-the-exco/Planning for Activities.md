<p>We have a big part to play in enriching our children’s school life, whether
we collaborate with the school for key school programmes, or organise parent-centric
activities. The activities and programmes that we plan should aim to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>support the<strong> child</strong> to enrich his/her learning in school;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support the <strong>school</strong> to strengthen school-based activities
and initiatives;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support the <strong>teachers </strong>to bring out the best in our children;
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support other <strong>parents </strong>in their parenting journey.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>What to note when planning an event or activity?</strong></h3>
<p>Effective PSGs bridge the needs of the parent community with the school's
objectives. Before planning events or activities, remember to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>consult your school partnership staff and school leaders to ensure alignment
and maximise the impact of your efforts; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consider the modality of the event (physical, virtual, or hybrid) to best
suit the needs of the activity and the participants.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Some areas to consider:</p>
<p><strong><u>***&lt;checklist/ image of areas&gt;***</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Assign at least 2 volunteers to organise each activity to share the workload.</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ensure every event has a teacher-in-charge and a key parent coordinator to ensure communication between the school and the PSG.</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Physical Events and Activities</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>Here are some examples of physical events and/or activities which PSGs
have conducted. We hope you find some ideas here.</p>

<h4><strong>Virtual Events and Activities</strong></h4>
<p>Since the Covid-19 pandemic, many PSGs have discovered the power of virtual
platforms to conduct events and activities, and have tapped on them to
keep communities connected, bridging distances and overcoming physical
limitations.</p>
<p>From online workshops to virtual family-bonding activities, the possibilities
are endless. However, organising a successful virtual event requires careful
planning to maximise the impact of each event. Tapping on technology may
help you reach out to more parents but you may be unable to capture their
full attention. Here are some additional considerations for organising
virtual events:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Choose the right platform: Ensure it is user-friendly and suits your event's
needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test your tech: Run a rehearsal to iron out potential glitches</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engage your audience: Incorporate interactive elements to maintain interest,
such as asking parents to participate by asking/replying to questions or
polls in the chat feature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plan for accessibility: Consider participants with different tech skills
or needs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Review Your Events and Activities</strong></h3>
<p>After each event, it is important to hold a review with all parents involved.
The feedback we gather from such reviews will be very helpful for the PSG
and the school when we plan our next event.</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who leads the review?</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typically, a review is best led by the parent(s)
who is/are in charge of the event.</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who should be involved?</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents who have helped out or
participated can give valuable feedback.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; School staff can also provide comments
from a different perspective.</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When do you do a review?</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do a quick review immediately after
the event, as the experience will be fresh in everyone’s mind.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some PSGs meet regularly (e.g.
every two months or termly) to discuss initiative and review programmes. <em>(Amizah, Admiralty Sec Sch staff &amp; Jacqueline, Riverside Pri Sch staff)</em>
</p>
<p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do you need to do a review?</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A framework to guide the review
discussion can be very helpful.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A simple framework to use is Keep,
Improve, Start, Stop (KISS), which prompts us to think about both the effective
and less effective parts of a programme.</p>
<p>Keep – Which parts are working well and should continue?</p>
<p>Improve – Which parts can be done better?</p>
<p>Start – What initiatives can we start to enhance school-home partnership?</p>
<p>Stop – Which parts are ineffective and do not benefit anyone?</p>
