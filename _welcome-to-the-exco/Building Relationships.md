<h3><strong>Maintain Communication with School</strong></h3>
<p>Regular communication with the school fosters a collaborative mindset
that the PSG is part of the school and strengthens the PSG’s ability to
contribute meaningfully and maximising their impact.</p>
<p><u>&lt;&lt;image&gt; &gt;</u>
</p>
<h3><strong>Cultivate Relationships among Parents</strong></h3>
<p>The PSG, like any volunteer group, is built on relationships. Parents
are likely to stay engaged when they feel valued and connected within the
community. To build a strong PSG community, we need to foster and sustain
the relationships through bonding activities and open communication within
the PSG, and between the PSG and the school.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Managing Differences</strong></h3>
<p>In a PSG, we have to work closely with the school and other parents. At
times, we may have to manage difficult situations. Below are some examples
PSGs may face, and how we can understand and manage the situations better.
Ultimately, it is important to bear in mind and remind each other that
regardless of our differences, we all need to work in the best interests
of children in the school and role model what we wish to see in our children.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, we set aside our personal indifferences, we overcome the challenges
and run the show for the benefits of our students, teachers and parents.</p>

<p>Managing Communication Channels</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Seek members’ permission before adding members to any chat or social media
group and keep their personal contact details confidential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be respectful in your conversations with each other. Try not to send messages
too late in the night.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep discussions to what is relevant to the PSG’s work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not use the PSG WhatsApp group chat to seek support for specific problems
that your child is facing in school. Such feedback should be given to the
school.</p>
</li>
</ul>
