<p>Every PSG belongs to a Support Circle usually with fellow PSGs near them,
so you have a community that you can always turn to.​ JCs and Millenia
Institute are in one Support Circle while the rest of the Support Circles
are based on <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/about-us/organisation-structure/sd/school-clusters" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">school clusters</a>.</p>
<p>Support Circles offer a great opportunity to learn and share ideas with
other PSGs. More experienced parents can share their experience and advice
with younger parents too. Check out what Support Circles have done on

<h3><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>A) Composition of Support Circles</strong></h4>
<p><strong>1. Who is part of the Support Circle?</strong>
</p>
<p>Each school may nominate up to four key representatives to be part of
the Support Circle. Ideally, these representatives should remain in the
Support Circle throughout the academic year to serve as the main points
of contact for Support Circle-related programmes. A typical composition
may include the PSG Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson, and two EXCO members.</p>
<p>
<br>If you are a PSG representative in the Support Circle, remember to keep
your PSG EXCO informed of key updates and share your learnings from the
Support Circle.</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;Is there any ‘leader/EXCO’ of a Support Circle?</strong>
</p>
<p>There is no official leader in the Support Circle — everyone has a role
to play in keeping it active and meaningful. The Support Circle functions
primarily as a community of PSGs, built on collaboration, shared ownership,
and mutual support.</p>
<h4><strong>B) Working Together as a Support Circle</strong></h4>
<p><strong>3. How do members of a Support Circle contact one another?</strong>
</p>
<p>Many Support Circle members stay connected through a dedicated WhatsApp
chat group. We encourage the chat group to remain limited to members of
the Support Circle to ensure focused and effective communication.</p>
<p>As a gentle reminder, please keep discussions respectful and relevant
— focusing on topics that support PSGs and benefit parents as well as our
children.</p>
<p><strong>4. What should I note for inter-PSG/ inter-school collaborations?</strong>
</p>
<p>When collaborating with other schools in your Support Circle, please ensure
that your respective schools’ partnership staff and school leaders are
aware of your collaborations. This helps ensure alignment and support from
all sides.</p>
<p>Even if it is just two schools partnering on an initiative, go for it!
Feel free to share the updates in your Support Circle WhatsApp group so
others can chime in with support, encouragement, or even join in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond the chat group, we also encourage Support Circle members to meet
in person at least once or twice a year. After all, there’s no better way
to strengthen bonds than over <em>kopi</em>, a meal, or activities!</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>5. How do we get funded for Support Circles' activities?</strong>
</p>
<p>Since 2017, the PSG Fund has been provided for under the School Operating
Fund (SOF) Block Grant. PSGs are encouraged to discuss their plans for
their PSGs and/or Support Circle with the School Partnership Staff, sharing
their plans and exploring potential partnerships with other PSGs. Through
such discussions, PSGs can seek school's support for such initiatives,
subject to resource availability. For more details on funding, refer to
