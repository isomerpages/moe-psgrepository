<h3><strong>Why join the Parent Support Group?</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>The Parent Support Group (PSG) is a great opportunity for us to be closer
to our children, understand them better, and help them in their education
journey.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our children also benefit when we are more active in their school environment.
They tend to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>show more positive attitudes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have better school attendance and complete homework more consistently</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be able to bridge the cultural gap between school and home</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be less anti-social and less prone to behavioural issues</p>
</li>
</ul>
