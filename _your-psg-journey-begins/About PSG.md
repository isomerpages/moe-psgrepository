<h3><strong>How can the PSG Contribute to the School?</strong></h3>
<p>You are a<strong> peer </strong>and <strong>resource</strong> supporter
to your parent community. We partner and support the school by volunteering
our <strong>3 Ts</strong>:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Time - </strong>We can volunteer our time to design and conduct
the school’s programmes and events. Supportive PSG members can help to
make the school a safe place for our children to learn in, making school
life more vibrant and caring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Talent - </strong>We can volunteer our expertise, talents, individual
interests or personal networks. In this way, parents can significantly
expand the pool of help available to the school and the PSG.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Thought - </strong>We can brainstorm and contribute constructive
feedback and ideas to improve the school and PSG. Support Circles offer
a great opportunity to learn and share ideas with other PSGs. More experienced
parents can share their experience and advice with younger parents too.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Why join the Parent Support Group?</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>The Parent Support Group (PSG) is a great opportunity for us to be closer
to our children, understand them better, and help them in their education
journey. Our children also benefit when we are more active in their school
environment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They tend to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>show more positive attitudes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have better school attendance and complete homework more consistently</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be able to bridge the cultural gap between school and home</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be less anti-social and less prone to behavioural issues</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>As a PSG member... </strong></h3>
<p><u>Respect Everyone</u>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Follow the school’s rules and respect the authority of the school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Respect the views and comments of fellow members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dress modestly when volunteering at school events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless authorised by the school leaders, do not represent the school at
any external platform (e.g. speaking to the media).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Participate actively</u>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Promote and participate actively in the school’s programmes for the benefit
of all children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide constructive feedback to the school through official channels
(e.g. dialogue sessions, PSG meetings).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h3><strong><s>Seek out your Support Circles</s></strong></h3>
<p><s>Every PSG belongs to a Support Circle usually with fellow PSGs near them, so you have a community that you can always turn to.​ Your Support Circle follows the zone your school is in.</s>
</p>
<p><s>What are Support Circles for? They are:</s>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><s>Your </s><strong><s>supporter</s></strong><s> and </s><strong><s>cheerleader </s></strong><s>when you start something positive in your PSG</s>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><s>Your </s><strong><s>bouncing board for brainstorming</s></strong><s> and </s><strong><s>collaboration </s></strong><s>for new ideas/initiatives</s>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><s>Your </s><strong><s>treasure vault of resources and ‘lobangs’ </s></strong><s>– when we share our knowledge, we grow and learn together</s>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><s>From being each other’s cheerleader to collaborating with one another, the possibilities are endless and that is the community we hope to build alongside with you! &nbsp;Check out your Support Circle’s strengths, wishes, goals and progress on Padlet <u>[To link?]</u></s>

<p><s><u>#1 Composition of Support Circles</u></s>
</p>
<p><strong><s>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is part of the Support Circle?</s></strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><s>Each school can nominate up to 4 key representatives who can ideally stay within the Support Circle for the whole academic year as the contact point for Support Circle related programmes. For example, this could look like 1 PSG Chairperson, 1 Vice-Chairperson and 2 EXCO members.</s>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><s>For PSG representatives who are part of the Support Circle, do keep the rest of your PSG EXCO updated on Support Circle happenings and share your learning from meetings with them.</s>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><s>In this way, you can identify another PSG rep to take-over from you in the subsequent year(s), if required.</s>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><s>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there any ‘leader/EXCO’ of a Support Circle?</s></strong>
</p>
<p><s>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no official leader, everyone has a part to play to keep the Support Circle going. The Support Circle functions primarily as a community of PSGs.</s>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><s><u>#2 Communication among Support Circle members</u></s>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><s>In terms of communications among Support Circle members, some of you may already be part of a Support Circle’s WhatsApp chat group.</s>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><s>Within the chat group, we encourage the chat group to be kept to members of the Support Circle only. Gentle reminder to be respectful on the group chat and keep the discussion to topics that will be useful to PSGs, parents and our children.</s>
</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><s><u>#3 Working Together as a Support Circle</u></s>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><s>When collaborating with other schools in your Support Circle, ensure that your respective schools’ partnership staff and school leaders are aware of your collaborations.</s>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><s>Even if just 2 schools within the Support Circle are collaborating, you can go ahead! You can let your other Support Circle friends know (through your WhatsApp channel) so that they can offer their support and encouragement.</s>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><s>Besides staying connected via the group chat, we encourage the Support Circle to try and meet at least once or twice a year to connect with each other. Afterall, what better way to bond than over kopi, a meal or activities.</s>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><s><u>#4 Financial Support for SC activities</u></s>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><s>Since 2017, the PSG Fund has been provided for under the School Operating Fund (SOF) Block Grant. PSGs are encouraged to discuss their plans for their PSGs and/or Support Circle with the School Partnership Staff, sharing their plans and exploring potential partnerships with other PSGs. Through such discussions, PSGs can seek school's support for such initiatives, subject to resource availability.</s>
