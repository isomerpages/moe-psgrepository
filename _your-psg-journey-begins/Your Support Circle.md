<p>Every PSG belongs to a Support Circle usually with fellow PSGs near them,
so you have a community that you can always turn to.​ JCs and Millenia
Institute are in one Support Circle while the rest of the Support Circles
are based on <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/about-us/organisation-structure/sd/school-clusters" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">school clusters</a>.</p>
<p>Support Circles offer a great opportunity to learn and share ideas with
other PSGs. More experienced parents can share their experience and advice
with younger parents too.</p>
<p>What are Support Circles for? They are:</p>

</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Your <strong>supporter</strong> and <strong>cheerleader </strong>when you
start something positive in your PSG</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your <strong>bouncing board for brainstorming</strong> and <strong>collaboration </strong>for
new ideas/initiatives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your <strong>treasure vault of resources and ‘lobangs’ </strong>– when
we share our knowledge, we grow and learn together</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From being each other’s cheerleader to collaborating with one another,
the possibilities are endless and that is the community we hope to build
alongside with you! &nbsp;Check out your Support Circle’s strengths, wishes,

<h3><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>A) Composition of Support Circles</strong></h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Who is part of the Support Circle?</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Each school can nominate up to 4 key representatives who can ideally stay
within the Support Circle for the whole academic year as the contact point
for Support Circle related programmes. For example, this could look like
1 PSG Chairperson, 1 Vice-Chairperson and 2 EXCO members.</p>
<p>For PSG representatives who are part of the Support Circle, do keep the
rest of your PSG EXCO updated on Support Circle happenings and share your
learning from meetings with them.</p>
<p>In this way, you can identify another PSG rep to take-over from you in
the subsequent year(s), if required.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;Is there any ‘leader/EXCO’ of a Support Circle?</strong>
</p>
<p>There is no official leader, everyone has a part to play to keep the Support
Circle going. The Support Circle functions primarily as a community of
PSGs.</p>
<h4><strong>B) Working Together as a Support Circle</strong></h4>
<p><strong>3. How do members of a Support Circle contact one another?</strong>
</p>
<p>In terms of communications among Support Circle members, some of you may
already be part of a Support Circle’s WhatsApp chat group.</p>
<p>Within the chat group, we encourage the chat group to be kept to members
of the Support Circle only. Gentle reminder to be respectful on the group
chat and keep the discussion to topics that will be useful to PSGs, parents
and our children.</p>
<p><strong>4. What should I note for inter-PSG/ inter-school collaborations?</strong>
</p>
<p>When collaborating with other schools in your Support Circle, ensure that
your respective schools’ partnership staff and school leaders are aware
of your collaborations.</p>
<p>Even if just 2 schools within the Support Circle are collaborating, you
can go ahead! You can let your other Support Circle friends know (through
your WhatsApp channel) so that they can offer their support and encouragement.</p>
<p>Besides staying connected via the group chat, we encourage the Support
Circle to try and meet at least once or twice a year to connect with each
other. Afterall, what better way to bond than over kopi, a meal or activities.</p>
<p><strong>5. How do we get funded for Support Circles' activities?</strong>
</p>
<p>Since 2017, the PSG Fund has been provided for under the School Operating
Fund (SOF) Block Grant. PSGs are encouraged to discuss their plans for
their PSGs and/or Support Circle with the School Partnership Staff, sharing
their plans and exploring potential partnerships with other PSGs. Through
such discussions, PSGs can seek school's support for such initiatives,
subject to resource availability. For more details on funding, refer to
