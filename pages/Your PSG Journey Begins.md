<h3><strong>Why join the Parent Support Group?</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>The Parent Support Group (PSG) is a great opportunity for us to be closer
to our children, understand them better, and help them in their education
journey. Our children also benefit when we are more active in their school
environment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They tend to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>show more positive attitudes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have better school attendance and complete homework more consistently</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be able to bridge the cultural gap between school and home</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be less anti-social and less prone to behavioural issues</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h3><strong>How can the PSG Contribute to the School?</strong></h3>
<p>You are a<strong> peer </strong>and <strong>resource</strong> supporter
to your parent community. We partner and support the school by volunteering
our <strong>3 Ts</strong>:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Time - </strong>We can volunteer our time to design and conduct
the school’s programmes and events. Supportive PSG members can help to
make the school a safe place for our children to learn in, making school
life more vibrant and caring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Talent - </strong>We can volunteer our expertise, talents, individual
interests or personal networks. In this way, parents can significantly
expand the pool of help available to the school and the PSG.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Thought - </strong>We can brainstorm and contribute constructive
feedback and ideas to improve the school and PSG. Support Circles offer
a great opportunity to learn and share ideas with other PSGs. More experienced
parents can share their experience and advice with younger parents too.</p>
</li>
</ul>
