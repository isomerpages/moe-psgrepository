<p>I had the opportunity to serve as Chairperson of my boys' Primary school
PSG when my oldest son was in Primary 2. Helping the school via PSG activities
was a good way for me to contribute, while keeping abreast on life in school
which created good conversation opportunities for me and my sons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a PSG leader, I get to help build a positive culture among the parents,
establishing a good spirit of giving and encouraging positive family bonding.
During my 10 years of service, the PSG and fathers group hosted numerous
father-child bonding activities, parent-child events and promoted a strong
volunteerism culture in the school. I'm grateful for all I've learnt and
how I've grown through these experiences.</p>
<p>Serving as a Zonal Leader now helps me multiply those learnings&nbsp;to
support younger PSG leaders as they seek to serve their schools to the
best of their abilities.</p>

<p>I believe parenting is a journey where we learn from each other, and ideally
every parent should be in a group or a committee where we share our best
practices or what we can do more on. I practised this even before I was
a Zonal Leader, mentoring others wherever I can. Years later, I feel a
sense of pride when I hear people say, "She is my mentor."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every one of us would love to leave behind a legacy. I hope my legacy
would be bringing creative minds together. The feeling of togetherness,
brainstorming and sharing ideas and executing them well will forge a strong
PSG community that can effectively partner our schools.</p>

<p>Initially, I joined PSG to support my first child’s education journey
since mine was so long ago. Working closely with the school helps me bridge
the gap.</p>
<p>Over time, I realised that my passion for people, extroverted personality
and skills sets as a working mum gave me the opportunity to lead my PSG
into a more structured &amp; sustainable voluntary group.</p>
<p>As a Zonal Leader, when I think about the PSG community, I think of a
community with a positive mindset, a big heart and a calling to make a
lasting impact for our children's future. The PSG community can definitely
be a POSITIVE Agent of CHANGE to shift parents’ mindsets for the better;
if the Village is Stronger, the child will definitely be Happier, More
Confident, and part of a Kinder Generation.</p>
