<p>“If I have a superpower, I would like to have the ability to help heal
people's emotional wounds. I experienced the damage what one did physically
and emotionally, when they are hurt - and they can take very long to recover
from the emotional wound…It would be cool if I had a power to help them!”</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yus</p>

<p>“I have always been interested in supporting and encouraging with people
with emotional issues, to build their confidence to a point where they
feel ready to take up a role that can benefit other people.</p>
<p>I want to be there empathetically for them, addressing and acknowledging
their emotions while they stay resilient.”</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hani</p>

<p>“I have a strong passion to support parents with special needs children
in mainstream schools. These parents are often struggling alone, unsure
how to improve things for their child and themselves. With my experience
in PSGs and a charity serving ADHD parents, I'm really thankful to be able
to propagate initiatives within Schools to provide parent peer support
to such parents.”</p>

<p>I believe parenting is a journey where we learn from each other, and ideally
every parent should be in a group or a committee where we share our best
practices or what we can do more on. I practised this even before I was
a Zonal Leader, mentoring others wherever I can. Years later, I feel a
sense of pride when I hear people say, "She is my mentor."&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every one of us would love to leave behind a legacy. I hope my legacy
would be bringing creative minds together. The feeling of togetherness,
brainstorming and sharing ideas and executing them well will forge a strong
PSG community that can effectively partner our schools.</p>

<p>I had the opportunity to serve as Chairperson of my boys' Primary school
PSG when my oldest son was in Primary 2. Helping the school via PSG activities
was a good way for me to contribute, while keeping abreast on life in school
which created good conversation opportunities for me and my sons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a PSG leader, I get to help build a positive culture among the parents,
establishing a good spirit of giving and encouraging positive family bonding.
During my 10 years of service, the PSG and fathers group hosted numerous
father-child bonding activities, parent-child events and promoted a strong
volunteerism culture in the school. I'm grateful for all I've learnt and
how I've grown through these experiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Serving as a Zonal Leader now helps me multiply those learnings&nbsp;to
support younger PSG leaders as they seek to serve their schools to the
best of their abilities.</p>

<p>Initially, I joined PSG to support my first child’s education journey
since mine was so long ago. Working closely with the school helps me bridge
the gap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over time, I realised that my passion for people, extroverted personality
and skills sets as a working mum gave me the opportunity to lead my PSG
into a more structured &amp; sustainable voluntary group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a Zonal Leader, when I think about the PSG community, I think of a
community with a positive mindset, a big heart and a calling to make a
lasting impact for our children's future. The PSG community can definitely
be a POSITIVE Agent of CHANGE to shift parents’ mindsets for the better;
if the Village is Stronger, the child will definitely be Happier, More
Confident, and part of a Kinder Generation.</p>
