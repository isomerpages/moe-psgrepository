<p>I believe parenting is a journey where we learn from each other, and ideally
every parent should be in a group or a committee where we share our best
practices or what we can do more on. I practised this even before I was
a Zonal Leader, mentoring others wherever I can. Years later, I feel a
sense of pride when I hear people say, "She is my mentor."&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every one of us would love to leave behind a legacy. I hope my legacy
would be bringing creative minds together. The feeling of togetherness,
brainstorming and sharing ideas and executing them well will forge a strong
PSG community that can effectively partner our schools.</p>

<p>I had the opportunity to serve as Chairperson of my boys' Primary school
PSG when my oldest son was in Primary 2. Helping the school via PSG activities
was a good way for me to contribute, while keeping abreast on life in school
which created good conversation opportunities for me and my sons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a PSG leader, I get to help build a positive culture among the parents,
establishing a good spirit of giving and encouraging positive family bonding.
During my 10 years of service, the PSG and fathers group hosted numerous
father-child bonding activities, parent-child events and promoted a strong
volunteerism culture in the school. I'm grateful for all I've learnt and
how I've grown through these experiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Serving as a Zonal Leader now helps me multiply those learnings&nbsp;to
support younger PSG leaders as they seek to serve their schools to the
best of their abilities.</p>

<p>Initially, I joined PSG to support my first child’s education journey
since mine was so long ago. Working closely with the school helps me bridge
the gap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over time, I realised that my passion for people, extroverted personality
and skills sets as a working mum gave me the opportunity to lead my PSG
into a more structured &amp; sustainable voluntary group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a Zonal Leader, when I think about the PSG community, I think of a
community with a positive mindset, a big heart and a calling to make a
lasting impact for our children's future. The PSG community can definitely
be a POSITIVE Agent of CHANGE to shift parents’ mindsets for the better;
if the Village is Stronger, the child will definitely be Happier, More
Confident, and part of a Kinder Generation.</p>

<h3><strong>Seek out your Support Circles</strong></h3>
<p>Every PSG belongs to a Support Circle usually with fellow PSGs near them,
so you have a community that you can always turn to.​ Your Support Circle
follows the zone your school is in.</p>
<p>What are Support Circles for? They are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Your <strong>supporter</strong> and <strong>cheerleader </strong>when you
start something positive in your PSG</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your <strong>bouncing board for brainstorming</strong> and <strong>collaboration </strong>for
new ideas/initiatives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your <strong>treasure vault of resources and ‘lobangs’ </strong>– when
we share our knowledge, we grow and learn together</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From being each other’s cheerleader to collaborating with one another,
the possibilities are endless and that is the community we hope to build
alongside with you! &nbsp;Check out your Support Circle’s strengths, wishes,
goals and progress on Padlet <u>[To link?]</u>

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p></p>
<p><u>#1 Composition of Support Circles</u>
</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is part of the Support Circle?</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Each school can nominate up to 4 key representatives who can ideally stay
within the Support Circle for the whole academic year as the contact point
for Support Circle related programmes. For example, this could look like
1 PSG Chairperson, 1 Vice-Chairperson and 2 EXCO members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For PSG representatives who are part of the Support Circle, do keep the
rest of your PSG EXCO updated on Support Circle happenings and share your
learning from meetings with them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this way, you can identify another PSG rep to take-over from you in
the subsequent year(s), if required.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there any ‘leader/EXCO’ of a Support Circle?</strong>
</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no official leader,
everyone has a part to play to keep the Support Circle going. The Support
Circle functions primarily as a community of PSGs.</p>
<p></p>
<p><u>#2 Communication among Support Circle members</u>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>In terms of communications among Support Circle members, some of you may
already be part of a Support Circle’s WhatsApp chat group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within the chat group, we encourage the chat group to be kept to members
of the Support Circle only. Gentle reminder to be respectful on the group
chat and keep the discussion to topics that will be useful to PSGs, parents
and our children.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><u>#3 Working Together as a Support Circle</u>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>When collaborating with other schools in your Support Circle, ensure that
your respective schools’ partnership staff and school leaders are aware
of your collaborations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if just 2 schools within the Support Circle are collaborating, you
can go ahead! You can let your other Support Circle friends know (through
your WhatsApp channel) so that they can offer their support and encouragement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Besides staying connected via the group chat, we encourage the Support
Circle to try and meet at least once or twice a year to connect with each
other. Afterall, what better way to bond than over kopi, a meal or activities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><u>#4 Financial Support for SC activities</u>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Since 2017, the PSG Fund has been provided for under the School Operating
Fund (SOF) Block Grant. PSGs are encouraged to discuss their plans for
their PSGs and/or Support Circle with the School Partnership Staff, sharing
their plans and exploring potential partnerships with other PSGs. Through
such discussions, PSGs can seek school's support for such initiatives,
subject to resource availability.</p>
